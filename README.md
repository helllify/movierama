This is my technical assignment as part of my interview process for the position of front end developer at Workable.

I had to create a movie application that would fetch currently playing movies and display them alongside relevant information like users' rating, description, video trailers reviews and more.

## Time frame

This app was created in 6 days.

## Points of interest

* `Intersection observer API` for 'infinite scrolling' experience and image lazyloading.
* Configurable and centralized data fetching via `serviceCall`,  a custom wrapper for configuring `axios` calls.
* Usage of `async/await` for data fetching.
